            <li><strong class="bloom-effect-tiny">Passion</strong>: I love code and I love beautiful code. I believe the code you deliver says
                something about you and
                you should be proud of it. I also love design, 3D design, pixel-art and illustration. Although there is
                a
                long path ahead of me, I do it for the enjoyment.</li>
            <li>
                <strong class="bloom-effect-tiny">Team work</strong>: Having worked as both a solo developer and within a team, I would always
                choose working with
                a
                team, not only because you can discuss and see different points of view, but also because you have more
                opportunities to learn and grow so you progress faster and better.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong class="bloom-effect-tiny">Creative</strong>: My interest in design is my true passion (it is why I like the front-end).
                In my free time I
                work
                on my own creative lab where I share my GPU experiments with the community. As a hobby, I am learning
                Unreal
                Engine and Blender.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong class="bloom-effect-tiny">Self-learning</strong>: Curious by nature, if I donâ€™t know the answer I will search for it,
                hence I have done
                many
                courses on different subjects like 3D Modelling, UI/UX, coding techniques and photogrammetry. Many of my
                achievements start this way.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong class="bloom-effect-tiny">Mentoring</strong>: I benefit a lot from contributing to different tech communities, and
                supporting others if I
                can,
                teaching both the whys and hows of coding. I have taught private classes, created an online course for
                EDTeam and write on different blog platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong class="bloom-effect-tiny">Grateful</strong>: I am grateful for the opportunities I have had, the people I have met and the
                things I have learned.I tried to give thanks everyday, and to everyone who has helped me in some way.
